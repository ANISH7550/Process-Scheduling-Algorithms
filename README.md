# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms
A collection of five classic CPU scheduling algorithms implemented in C++ â€” FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin. Each algorithm runs on Linux/Unix terminals with clear input/output formatting and example test cases. Perfect for learning Operating System concepts like waiting time, turnaround time, and process handling
